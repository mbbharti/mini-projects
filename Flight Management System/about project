It is a project, I named it Flight Management System 
Which contains fare and distance between 2 vertex or can say airport
initially it contains 9 airport/vertex numbered from 0 to 8
The program can add, remove any vertex and can also change distance and fare between any two vertex
and can also show the shortest path
